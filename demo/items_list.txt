Game Rules      		*Actual time/strength to be determined at game balancing

- Main objective to explore and capture zones
- Zone capture determined by state of either contested or uncontested
- Zones captured are held for set minimum amount of time, with weekends opening up most zones
  except for special zones and those protected by items*
- Challenges events can be completed to gain RP and items that will help with zones captures in the game, see Item List
- Lower tier items can also be gained through limited zone captures and 'item' chests placed on the map
- Players are assigned to their respective hometown, though this may change.
	- Ideas include player option to swap hometown once a week
	- Or just using area of where activity began as hometown
- Players of same town are grouped together.
- Towns will compete against other town to advance their turf territoty.
- Territory is advanced by capturing zones for your hometown, if zone is near other zones held by hometown
  territory will advance (e.g. it should not be an isolated zone. Though isolated zone capture is possible)
- Town with less players will get a series of handicaps to help vs larger towns/cities with more players
- Via the game balancing and handicaps, protecting ones own town territory should be relatively, with occasional
  encroachments by other towns
- Ex: A player on holiday in Cornwall, could capture zones on behalf of Cambridge and vice-versa,
  connect zones with draw turf ownership on map until recaptured or captured by other towns
- Items add several abilities and modifiers to the game.
